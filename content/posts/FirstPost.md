I am a highly skilled and experienced professional with a diverse background in various technical fields, including Threat analysis, DevOps, penetration testing, and incident response. My strong foundation in programming has allowed me to automate tasks and processes, increasing efficiency for my teams. As a specialised generalist, I am able to adapt to new environments and confidently tackle a wide range of challenges.

In addition to my technical expertise, I have significant experience in management. I have led and mentored teams, developed and implemented processes, and driven projects to successful completion. My leadership skills, combined with my technical expertise, make me a valuable asset to any organisation.
