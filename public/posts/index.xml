      <description>Earlier this month i attended a local sec talk, the main event was working to resolve the MercyV2 vulnhub box.
Unfornately during the event i couldnt do the box as mac m1s dont support x86 virtual machines :P So i spent most of the night talking shit and helping teach some new cyber trainies steps on how to enumerate the box. No one finished the box or got close at the event that we know of so when i got home i took it as a challenge to finish it.</description>
