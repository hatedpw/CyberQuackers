[{"content":" I\u0026rsquo;d like to bring to your attention a new and dangerous attack vector that is spreading malware through .ONE files. These files, also known as Microsoft OneNote files, may appear to be from a trusted source, but in reality, they can contain malwarel.\nIn recent months, we have seen an increase in the number of threat actor groups utilizing .ONE files as a means to spread malware. Groups such as Async, Qakbot, and Redline are known to have used this technique to target individuals and organizations alike. These groups are constantly evolving their tactics as the ever changing landscape makes old techniques harder, With the recent changes Microsoft made to disable macro\u0026rsquo;s globally we saw these groups pivot once again to an old but successful method for spreading their malicious content.\nWhat sets this attack vector apart from other email-based threats is that the malware in .ONE files is executed instantly when you click on a photo or button in the .one file. Unlike office macros, which require enabling content, this makes the attack vector even more dangerous to unsuspecting users who may not realize they are running a malicious file. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen many samples containing up to 10 different .bat payloads!\nRapid7 covered a redline sample on this!\nTo protect yourself against this threat, I recommend following these tips: General users There are also several steps that can be taken to stay safe from .ONE file malware. Firstly, avoid opening attachments from unknown or untrusted sources. Secondly, be cautious when downloading files, especially those that appear to be from a trusted source. Finally, if you receive a .ONE file from an unknown source or one that appears suspicious, report the email to IT and never open it!\nIT teams There are several simple technical measures that can be taken to limit the impact of .ONE files on the organization. Firstly, configuring email filters to block attachments with the .ONE file extension can help prevent malicious files from reaching employees. Secondly, implementing endpoint protection software with the latest signatures and updates can help detect and prevent malware infections caused by .ONE files. Finally, providing regular security awareness training to employees can help them recognize the signs of a malicious files and avoid falling for social engineering tactics.\nBy following these simple steps, you can help protect yourself and your organization from the dangers of .ONE file malware.\nIn conclusion, the .ONE file malware threat is a serious issue that should not be taken lightly. By following safe security practices and being mindful of email attachments, you can help protect yourself from this dangerous attack vector.

But in reality, most breaches are caused by simple mistakes. So in this post, I will be going over a breach that could likely happen in the future and how it could have been prevented.\nSo let us start with the basics. What is a breach? A breach is when an adversary gains access to a system and steals data. This can be done in many ways, but the most common way is through phishing. Phishing is when a threat actor sends a fake email to a user and tricks them into clicking a link or opening an attachment. This is a widespread attack vector that many adversaries consistently use.\nThis story starts with a simple but effective phish.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve opened up an email, and it\u0026rsquo;s demanding that you sign these important documents that need to be reviewed, and you need to do it now. You click the link and are taken to a legitimate website; This is the official box domain, a trusted domain in which many users share documents all the time. So you let your guard down and read further.\nIt says to click here to read the document. Oh, that\u0026rsquo;s weird.. but is hosted on an official website, it must be fine. So you click the link and are taken to a page that looks like this.\nThis looks like 365 web view for word document editing, but the key difference is the URL. This is not the official portal.office.com URL. This is a URL that is hosted on a domain that Microsoft does not own. This is a phishing site. You are prompted with a login screen, and you enter your credentials. You click login, and nothing happens. It just says error wrong password or email, please try again.\nYou repeat this process a few times, and you get frustrated. You think, \u0026ldquo;I know my password is correct, I just changed it yesterday, and I know my email is correct. I just sent an email to myself to check it. So why is it not working?\u0026rdquo; You then think, \u0026ldquo;Maybe I need to change my password again, maybe I forgot it.\u0026rdquo; But each time you click login. The username and password were sent to the threat actor and saved into their database.\nThe credentials have been stolen, and the threat actor can now login to your account and do whatever they want. So, for example, they can send emails to your contacts, delete your files, and even download them. You might think I am just a low-level person who cares if I get phished, right? Wrong, you have access to very sensitive data, and stealing a single account, even one that isn\u0026rsquo;t important now, can lead to even more significant breaches later down the line through internal phishing attacks and lateral movement inside the network.\nThis is a very simple and straightforward attack used by thousands of adversaries daily. Why? Because it works.\nSo how can we prevent this?\nALWAYS check the URLs; if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look right, stop and alert your IT Team! Think, should I be getting this email? Does it make any sense? Do I know this person? Communicate with co-workers. Did they receive this to? Why would Jim, the intern get this invoice as well? If you are unsure, don\u0026rsquo;t click the link, don\u0026rsquo;t open the attachment, dont enter your credentials. Report the email to your IT team. They will assist you as it has most likely been sent to everyone around you. The most crucial step is NEVER to feel scared to reach out to your IT team. Everyone, including security professionals, will fall for a phish at some point in their life. All it takes is that you aren\u0026rsquo;t paying attention one time, and boom, you\u0026rsquo;ve just given up your password. Reporting these incidents allows IT staff to investigate and resolve the issue before it can cause damage to the company.\nUnderstand that taking these steps will never fully guarantee your safety from phishing attacks but can help reduce your likelihood of getting phished.\nOkay but what about the billion dollar breach? I was able to obtain access to the database where the passwords for this phish are stored, when I first looked at the list, it only had around 20 email/passwords stored, but only five hours later, it had over 260 stolen credentials. Many of these belonged to managers and staff from companies estimated to have over a billion net worth.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t let this happen to you. Be vigilant and always be on the lookout for phishing emails.\nDisclaimer: I have reported the location where the log files are being held, and until the website is taken down, I am monitoring the data being added to it and will then submit the information to https://haveibeenpwned.com/ to alert users of the breach.\nPhish IOCS:\nhXXps://hulking-citrine-krypton[.]glitch[.]me/flk[.]html hXXps://ssvilvensstokes[.]app[.]box[.]com/notes/1033258185693?s=7b1zk6io9kmxqnau2agt3pr56e6czuwu\n","permalink":"https://hatedpw.github.io/CyberQuackers/posts/a-simple-phish-leads-to-a-billion-dollar-company-being-breached/","summary":"When we think of a company getting breached generally, people think of some advanced attack that took months of planning and execution.
