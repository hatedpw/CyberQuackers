[{"content":"Earlier this month, I attended a local sec talk. The main event was working to resolve the MercyV2 vulnhub box.\nUnfortunately during the event, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the box as mac m1s don\u0026rsquo;t support x86 virtual machines :P So I spent most of the night talking shit and helping teach some new cyber trainees steps on how to enumerate the box. No one finished the box or got close at the event that we know of so when I got home, I took it as a challenge to finish it. MercyV2 is a fun little box that focuses on in-depth enumeration and multi-account escalation. I liked it a lot.\nLet us begin the walkthrough! I begin with a Nmap scan on the device. I usually like to do a quick scan to see what is running.\nNmap 192.168.253.131 open 53/tcp open domain 110/tcp open pop3 139/tcp open netbios-ssn 143/tcp open imap 445/tcp open microsoft-ds 993/tcp open imaps 995/tcp open pop3s 8080/tcp open http-proxy cool so can see a basic range of ports available on this device. Lets scan with nmap again.\nnmap -sC -sV 192.168.253.131 PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 22/tcp filtered ssh 53/tcp open domain ISC BIND 9.9.5-3ubuntu0.17 (Ubuntu Linux) | dns-nsid: |_ bind.version: 9.9.5-3ubuntu0.17-Ubuntu 80/tcp filtered http 110/tcp open pop3? 139/tcp open netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP) 143/tcp open imap Dovecot imapdimage.png |_ssl-date: TLS randomness does not represent time 445/tcp open netbios-ssn Samba smbd 4.3.11-Ubuntu (workgroup: WORKGROUP) 993/tcp open ssl/imaps? 995/tcp open ssl/pop3s? 8080/tcp open http Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP engine 1.1 | http-methods: |_ Potentially risky methods: PUT DELETE |_http-open-proxy: Proxy might be redirecting requests | http-robots.txt: 1 disallowed entry |_/tryharder/tryharder |_http-server-header: Apache-Coyote/1.1 |_http-title: Apache Tomcat We get back some good information: Server running ssh, SMB, apache tomcat/Coyote JSP engine 1.1 I dont want to bruteforce this box so ill skip ssh for now. I first want to start with reviewing the URLs that came back. See if any notes could be found there. port 80 is filter, so ignore. 8080 is open lets go check it out.\nSo we confirm its running tomcat. Can see a webapp and a hostmanager! these might be useful later.\nLets check robots. Alright ill bite Cool this looks like a base64 string. Lets slap that into cyberchef.\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 It\u0026#39;s annoying, but we repeat this over and over again: cyber hygiene is extremely important. Please stop setting silly passwords that will get cracked with any decent password list. Once, we found the password \u0026#34;password\u0026#34;, quite literally sticking on a post-it in front of an employee\u0026#39;s desk! As silly as it may be, the employee pleaded for mercy when we threatened to fire her. No fluffy bunnies for those who set insecure passwords and endanger the enterprise. Hmm password\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; Lets go try that management page.. Welp default stuff failed!\nfurther investigation required.

Time to google! So basically its a sequence of ports to knock on which will enable access to that port. This is pretty cool. It also explains why nmap returned filtered for port 22 and 80. Meaning that the port is open but the service is not until you knock on the port. From my research i can easily use netcat to do this. Again i only want to do port 80 for now as i want to see how i can get without ssh.\nnc 192.168.253.131 159 nc 192.168.253.131 27391 nc 192.168.253.131 4 Rescanning with nmap we have access to port 80!\nPORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 80/tcp open http Apache httpd 2.4.7 ((Ubuntu)) | http-robots.txt: 2 disallowed entries |_/mercy /nomercy |_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu) |_http-title: Site doesn\u0026#39;t have a title (text/html).

Congratulations on being able to root MERCY. The author feels bittersweet about this box. On one hand, it was a box designed as a dedication to the sufferance put through by the Offensive Security team for PWK. I thought I would pay it forward by creating a vulnerable machine too. This is not meant to be a particularly difficult machine, but is meant to bring you through a good number of enumerative steps through a variety of techniques. The author would also like to thank a great friend who he always teases as \u0026#34;plead for mercy\u0026#34;. She has been awesome. The author, in particular, appreciates her great heart, candour, and her willingness to listen to the author\u0026#39;s rants and troubles. The author will stay forever grateful for her presence. She never needed to be this friendly to the author. The author, as \u0026#34;plead for mercy\u0026#34; knows, is terrible at any sort of dedication or gifting, and so the best the author could do, I guess, is a little present, which explains the hostname of this box. (You might also have been pleading for mercy trying to root this box, considering its design.) You\u0026#39;ll always be remembered, \u0026#34;plead for mercy\u0026#34;, and Offensive Security, for making me plead for mercy! Congratulations, once again, for you TRIED HARDER!

But in reality, most breaches are caused by simple mistakes. In this post I will be going over a breach that could likely happen in future and how it could have been prevented.\nSo lets start with the basics. What is a breach? A breach is when a hacker gains access to a system and steals data. This can be done in many ways, but the most common way is through phishing. Phishing is when a hacker sends a fake email to a user and tricks them into clicking a link or opening an attachment. This is a very common attack vector and is used by many hackers.\nThis story starts with a simple but effective phish.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve opened up an email and its demanding that you sign these important documents that need to be reviewed, and you need to do it now. You click the link and are taken to a website that is all legitmate, This is the offical box domain, a trusted domain which many users share documents all the time. So you let your guard down and read further.\nIt says to click here to read the document, oh thats weird.. but oh well its coming from the offical domain so it must be fine. You click the link and are taken to a page that looks like this.\nVisually this looks exactly like 365 web view for word document editing, but the key difference is the URL. This is not the offical portal.office.com URL. This is a URL that is hosted on a domain that is not owned by Microsoft. This is a phishing site. You are prompted with a login screen, and you enter your credentials. You click login and nothing happens, it just says error wrong password or email please try again.\nYou repeat this process a few times, and you get frustrated. You think to yourself, \u0026ldquo;I know my password is correct, I just changed it yesterday, and I know my email is correct, I just sent an email to myself to check it. So why is it not working?\u0026rdquo; You then think to yourself, \u0026ldquo;Maybe I need to change my password again, maybe I forgot it.\u0026rdquo; But each time you clicked login. The username and password was being sent to the threat actor and saved into their database.\nNow the credentials have been stolen, the threat actor can now login to your account and do whatever they want. They can send emails to your contacts, they can delete your files, they can even download your files and send them to their own email.\nThis is a very simple attack and is used by thousands of attackers every day. Why? Because it works.\nSo how can we prevent this?\nALWAYS check the URLs and if it doesnt look right, stop and alert your IT Team! Think, should i be getting this email? Does it make any sense? Do i know this person? Communicate with co-workers, did they recieve this to? Why would Jim the intern get this invoice? If you are unsure, dont click the link, dont open the attachment, dont enter your credentials. Report the email to your IT team. They will assist you as it has most likely been sent to everyone around you. Okay but what about the billion dollar breach? I was able to get access to the database where the passwords for this phish are being stored, when i first looked at the list it only had around 20 email/passwords stored, but only five hours later it had over 260 stolen credentials. Many of these belonged to managers and staff from companies that were estimated over a billion dollars.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t let this happen to you. Be vigilant and always be on the lookout for phishing emails.\nIOCS:\nhXXps://hulking-citrine-krypton[.]glitch[.]me/flk[.]html hXXps://ssvilvensstokes[.]app[.]box[.]com/notes/1033258185693?s=7b1zk6io9kmxqnau2agt3pr56e6czuwu\n","permalink":"https://hatedpw.github.io/CyberQuackers/posts/a-simple-phish-leads-to-a-billion-dollar-company-being-breached/","summary":"When we think of a company getting breached, gerenerally people think of some advanced attack that took months of planning and execution.
